OVERVIEW
========

This repository contains the source/translated TS files for MeeGo UX
language packs.


CONTRIBUTING TRANSLATIONS
=========================

The toplevel translations/ directory in this repository is a revolving
snapshot of the MeeGo UX project on Transifex.

This means that *all* translation activity happens on Transifex and
that Transifex is the upstream source of translations for MeeGo UX
apps.

To contribute new translations, join a translation team for the MeeGo
project at https://meego.transifex.net/projects/p/meego/teams/, and
then navigate to the desired MeeGo UX release to begin translation
work (see https://meego.transifex.net/projects/p/meego-ux/).


RELEASE PROCESS
===============

To make a new release, run

  $ make dist

in the top-level source directory.
